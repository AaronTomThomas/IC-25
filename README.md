# **Sentinel ðŸš”**  
*A police dashboard leveraging DeckGL for powerful data visualisations and AI-driven resource allocation.*

## **Overview**  
Sentinel is a hackathon-built tool designed to help law enforcement **visualise crime data** and **allocate resources proactively** using AI. By combining **DeckGL** for stunning geospatial visualisations and an AI-powered backend, Sentinel provides **insights that can help prevent crime before it happens.**  

âš  **Disclaimer:** The code is **hacky and messy**â€”this was built during a hackathon. Expect questionable design choices, hardcoded variables, and very little error handling. Youâ€™ve been warned.

## **Features**
- ðŸ—º **DeckGL-powered visualisations** for crime hotspots, patrol routes, and predictive analytics.  
- ðŸ¤– **AI-driven crime prediction** to optimise resource allocation.  
- ðŸš“ **Dynamic police unit assignment** based on real-time data and historical trends.  
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive dashboard** with crime heatmaps, time-series insights, and response metrics.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Frontend (React)**
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:  
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### **Backend (Flask & AI Model)**
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Activate the Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Start the AI-driven crime model server:
    ```bash
    python crime_model_server.py
    ```
5. The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + DeckGL
- **Backend:** Flask + AI Model
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- **Visualisation:** DeckGL, Mapbox

### **Future Improvements (If We Had More Time ðŸ˜…)**
- âœ… Improve AI model accuracy by incorporating live crime feeds.
- âœ… Refactor the horribly messy codebase.
- âœ… Add authentication & access control for sensitive police data.
- âœ… Implement a proper API rather than hardcoded endpoints.
- âœ… Deploy to cloud with Docker + Kubernetes for scalability.
