Sentinel ðŸš”
A police dashboard leveraging DeckGL for powerful data visualisations and AI-driven resource allocation.

Overview
Sentinel is a hackathon-built tool designed to help law enforcement visualise crime data and allocate resources proactively using AI. By combining DeckGL for stunning geospatial visualisations and an AI-powered backend, Sentinel provides insights that can help prevent crime before it happens.

âš  Disclaimer: The code is hacky and messyâ€”this was built during a hackathon. Expect questionable design choices, hardcoded variables, and very little error handling. 

Features
ðŸ—º DeckGL-powered visualisations for crime hotspots, patrol routes, and predictive analytics.
ðŸ¤– AI-driven crime prediction to optimise resource allocation.
ðŸš“ Dynamic police unit assignment based on real-time data and historical trends.
ðŸ“Š Interactive dashboard with crime heatmaps, time-series insights, and response metrics.

Future Improvements (If We Had More Time ðŸ˜…)
âœ… Improve AI model accuracy by incorporating live crime feeds.
âœ… Refactor the horribly messy codebase.
âœ… Add authentication & access control for sensitive police data.
âœ… Implement a proper API rather than hardcoded endpoints.
âœ… Deploy to cloud with Docker + Kubernetes for scalability.
